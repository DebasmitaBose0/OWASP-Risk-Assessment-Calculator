🔐 OWASP Risk Assessment Calculator

A Python-based tool for performing risk assessments following the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.
This calculator helps security professionals, students, and developers quantify security risks by combining likelihood and impact scores into a measurable risk level.

📖 About

The OWASP Risk Assessment Calculator simplifies the process of evaluating application security risks by:

Mapping OWASP risk rating factors into a structured calculator.

Allowing users to input values for Threat Agent, Vulnerability, Technical Impact, and Business Impact.

Automatically computing the Overall Risk Rating (Low / Medium / High / Critical).

Providing a standardized approach useful for developers, researchers, and security auditors.

🚀 Features

✅ Implements OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.

✅ Interactive command-line interface (CLI).

✅ Supports customizable inputs for different applications.
